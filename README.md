# Droshed

Projet Android

This project was developed by IchRak Rezgui, Christophe Dos Santos and Mohamed Kacem Jlili.
The purpose of this project Droshed (DRoid SHeet EDitor) is to realize an Android application in charge of editing spreadsheets in two dimensions in communication with a web server
providing the model of the leaves and storing the filled sheets.

# How to connect to web server

You have to use an identifier and a password.
The user is '**sudo**' and the password is '**root**'.
But if you would like to change the user and the password, you have to change the content of the .auth file.
The format file is **user:password**.

# How to use Droshed

Launch script called launchServer.sh to start server.
_The server is binding on port 4545_.

Once you are connected, you could edit your own files or create new spreadsheet.
To create new spreadsheet, touch add-Button, choose a model and edit your file.
